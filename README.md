Briefly describe why is it interesting/challenging:

It is challenging as the model has to accurately transfer the facial expressions and movements to a target face. This involves huge calculations as it needs to capture small details like eye movements, head movements, lip synchronization etc, to avoid noticeable artifacts. Besides that, it requires powerful GPUs to handle the face swapping and video generation. This causes me couldnâ€™t run on my local machine, so I have to do it on google colab.

It is interesting because we can swap human faces to create a convincing illusion, make someone appear to do things that others would never have believed they did, like appearing on a tv show, dancing in front of many audiences and something that didn't talk before.
